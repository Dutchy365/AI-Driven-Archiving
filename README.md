## Title
AI driven archiving of SharePoint Sites

## Description
This project addresses the challenges faced by SharePoint administrators and archivists in managing the complete lifecycle of SharePoint sites. In many organizations, SharePoint sites often exist without clear ownership, leaving archivists to evaluate whether they should be archived and under what retention policies. This process can be time-consuming, particularly when managing a large number of sites.

The goal of this project is to streamline the archiving process and provide support to archivists, making SharePoint site management more efficient and mature. A Power App has been developed to offer a comprehensive overview of SharePoint sites, providing key data such as last modification dates and usage statistics.

The solution incorporates AI-powered assessments to generate summaries of the sites and detect sentiment, helping archivists make informed decisions about archiving. Additionally, a SharePoint agent is provisioned on demand, enabling users to engage in conversations about the site. This tool also allows archivists to confidently set archiving statuses or seek a second opinion from colleagues.
Overall, the project simplifies and accelerates the archiving process, ensuring proper lifecycle management of SharePoint sites with the help of AI technology.
